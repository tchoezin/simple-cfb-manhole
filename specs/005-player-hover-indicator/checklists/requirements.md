## Notes

- All items pass on first pass. This feature is a focused visual refinement of the existing feature 003 hover interaction.
- 2026-08-30: Ran `/speckit.clarify` — user specified the indicator should be a progress/loading-style cue (not a static style change) that disappears once the dialog opens. Spec updated accordingly (Clarifications section, User Story 1, Edge Cases, FR-001–FR-008, Key Entities, SC-001–SC-005, Assumptions). All checklist items still pass.
